Apoorv Verma - SOC Update 

I started by revising the basic python syntax and libraries - numpy,pandas,matplotlib etc.
After that I started watching the lectures in the Andrew NG ML course on coursera.
In the first three weeks I got the basic idea of machine learning, the cost function, how 
the gradient descent is used to minimize cost function and various parameters to alter in it
and linear regression with one variable. In subsequent weeks I got the idea of neural networks -
neurons and model representation.

Currently I am trying and asignment given by mentor and then will start with the code of the 
main project.
